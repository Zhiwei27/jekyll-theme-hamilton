<p>Hi, I'm Zhiwei Lin, currently a second-year master's student at Stony Brook University, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I am interested in data science and actuarial science. I've gained valuable experience through various projects and have successfully passed multiple SOA actuarial exams, including P, FM, IFM, STAM, and SRM. I earned my bachelor's degree in Biology and Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Stony Brook University in 2021.</p>
